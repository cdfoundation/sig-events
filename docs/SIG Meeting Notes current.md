## May 8

### Participants
* Steve Pereira
* Emil Bäckmark, Ericsson, UTC+2
* \<please add yourself\>

### Agenda

- Action items from last meeting
    - (Emil) prepare SIG Events/CDEvents project info needed by TOC
    - ~~(Andrea) follow up on needed updates of the CDEvents Whitepaper~~

- Updates from other CDF Groups
    - CDEvents Workgroup
        - CDEvents v0.3 released
            - Testing events reiterated and placed in new bucket
            - Artifact signed event
    - TOC
        - Tracy Ragan is now our SIG sponsor
        - [TOC Project representatives elections](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/pull/202/files?short_path=ff37c30#diff-ff37c3064e1c5d7bef2269062e40afd924448d1df50c63cbedcd3f1af1328742)
            - CDEvents should nominate a candidate between May 22 and June 5. Whom to nominate will be decided on a coming CDEvents meeting.
            - 4 seats available (from 9 projects)

- CNCF TAG App Delivery
    - We participated on their meeting on May 3
    - CDEvents was discussed to be implemented in [Podtato-head](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head)
    - Collaboration should continue. We should meet again in about a month.

- CDEvents Whitepaper for cdCon
    - To be published on cdCon this week (?)

- Who is currently using CDEvents?
    - We got this question from somewhere - don't know where
    - No one is *actually* using CDEvents in production yet

- Spinnaker implementation of CDEvents
    - What types of events should be mandatory/possible to send?
    - No such list of mandatory events exist at the moment
    - Spinnaker is free to implement support for any type of event types
    - Some should probably be implicitly sent (if configured to do so), like PipelineRun and TaskRun events, others should probably require an explicit "step" in the Spinnaker pipeline config

- Interoperability initiative together with VSMI
    - Dive deeper into the VSMI collaboration & finish reviewing VSMI deck
    - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16-c-Kui3LKmiIc54N7f_4tebTt-zcbCnKDypksT5WRo/edit#slide=id.p
    - Where to keep all data? Some data lake will be needed
    - VSM is mostly interested in historical data, to see trends on the value in a system of work, while CDEvents is both interested in historical data (visualization, metrics, etc) AND realtime data for triggering and such
    - There is an overlap between the data for VSM and the data for CI/CD. CI/CD data is probably not a pure subset of VSM data.
    - VSM is more about inspecting how a "system of work" is evolving over time and with new/improved/changed value added to it
    - CI/CD for historical data is more about individual pipelines/workflows and their trends
    - A long discussion was held but not all documented here
    - Discussion to be continued on our next SIG meeting, if possible. Until then we could dig into Steve's presentation and also the joint Charter.

            - To be clarified what level of overlap exists between VSM architecture and CDF reference architecture
            - Can be viewed from a customer value perspective, what kind of customer requirements are shared across between the two architectures
        - Interoperability is a challenge today - wiring data from the different data sources along the value stream
        - Scope is everything that produce metrics along the value stream
        - Very early stages - evaluating the architecture
        - VSMI currently running through OASIS
    - Steve presented the current VSMI Reference Architecture

    - Ongoing internally at Fidelity

- JavaSDK for CDEvents v0.2
    - Might be possible for Adam to look into
    - The Java SDK might be able to reuse some parts of the Go SDK for example-event handling and test cases. There is a component that generate the event specifiic parts of the Go SDK from schema files, and it could potentially generate parts of the Java SDK as well.
        - A first version of that code generation tool is available as a PR on the Go SDK: https://github.com/cdevents/sdk-go/pull/43/files
            - The idea is to create an event.<language>.tmpl file per SDK language
    - The Java SDK should also be properly released on GitHub for 0.2

### Participants

- Emil Bäckmark, Ericsson, UTC+1
- Andrea Frittoli, IBM, UTC
- Jalander Ramagiri, Ericsson Software Technology, UTC

### Agenda

- Action Items From Last meeting

- Updates From other CDF Groups
    - CDF TOC
        - [Projects benefits](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/issues/168) document about to be written
        - Each CDF project should be invited to have a participant on TOC meetings. Emil is representing CDEvents there.
    - CDEvents Workgroup
        - [Incident events](https://github.com/cdevents/spec/pull/107)
        - [Testing events](https://github.com/cdevents/spec/pull/105)
    - SIG Interoperability
        - [Latest Techstrong TV episode in "The CD Pipeline" series](https://techstrong.tv/videos/cd-pipeline/interoperability-challenges-and-solutions-the-cd-pipeline-ep-4) is about Interoperability
        - Value Stream Mapping
            - Meeting with VSM folks on Jan 24th
            - A working group together with [VSM Interoperability](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=vsmi) is intended to be started

- Google Summer of Code
    - [Mentor organization applications](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/01/mentor-organization-applications-are-open-for-google-summer-of-code-2023.html) accepted until Feb 7th
    - The Jenkins community is preparing a GSoC application, based on [these ideas](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/)
        - Fidelity is probably interested in a CDEvents project with Jenkins
    - Other CDF projects have similar plans?

- Presentations
    - _No presentation planned today_
    - Testkube planned for next meeting

- Upcoming Conferences
    - [cdCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon-gitopscon/) May 8-9th, Vancouver - CFP closes on Feb 10th
    - [Open Source Summit NA](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) May 10-12th, Vancouver - CFP closes on Feb 5th

- Spinnaker updates
    - Meeeting tomorrow about the PR with CDEvents

- Java SDK for CDEvents v0.1 soon to be done
    - https://github.com/cdevents/sdk-java/pull/12
    - It would be valuable to provide validation in the Java SDK to validate the generated events towards the CDEvents schemas. It's not a requirement for an SDK, but good to have. The Go SDK has something along those lines.

- Visualizations of CDEvents
    - DORA Metrics (with incident events) is probably the only ongoing initiative in this area
