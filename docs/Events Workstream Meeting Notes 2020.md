### Agenda and Notes

#### Charter
- On December 7th, we decided on working on a charter for our workstream. You can find the working document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cuaOHmrvK20WxHxHZZuLif3CW3q1ICZ_RglJRp_IAQ0/edit?usp=sharing)
- Main focus areas for the Events SIG
  - Defining a protocol, and documenting it
  - Providing how to apply the protocol in different use cases, such as monitoring, triggering activities, audits, etc
  - Providing a reference implementation of services/libraries showcasing the protocol
- We should all review and contribute to the charter before or on the next meeting

#### CD-Flow
Mauricio will provide a presentation on this work in a later meeting

#### FOSDEM CI/CD Devroom
It could be nice to present the work of this group at [FOSDEM 2021](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/continuous_integration_and_continuous_deployment/).
The CFP closes on Dec 27, the conference takes place (virtually) on 6, 7 Feb 2021.

#### cdCon 2021
We should contribute to it
- cdCon will be in June
- CFP (not open yet)
- 'Event driven CI/CD' could be a valid topic
- https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cdcon/

#### Other conferences
Online DevOps online summit, on Slack. Tracy has been asked to set up a CI/CD channel for it.

#### Contribute to Metadata workstream
Metadata workstream is about to get started and we should provide any input we have that relates to metadata to it: [Standardized Metadata](https://hackmd.io/BYbkuR8uSlKt_w7Y4KE1OQ)
- We never discussed this agenda point at this meeting

#### Next Meeting
4th of January is skipped so first meeting after new year will be 18th of January? Or do we want a meeting before the TOC meeting where the workstream becoming a SIG will be lifted? When is the next SIG Interop meeting?
AP Emil: Ask Tracey/Fatih to cancel the meeting January 4th

## Meeting December 7th
Meeeting time in your timezone [here](https://time.is/1600_7_December_2020_in_UTC). You're welcome to join!

Participants:
* Ravi Lachhman, Harness
* Andreas Grimmer, Dynatrace
* Emil Bäckmark, Ericsson
* Steve Taylor, DeployHub
* Mattias Linnér, Ericsson
* Tracy Ragan, DeployHub
* Andrea Frittoli, IBM

### Agenda and Notes

#### Use Cases from DeployHub on this workstream
- Interested in seeing some of the CDF projects move into an event driven pipeline
- Ortelius keeps track of deliveries that are to be deployed and their relationships
    - Generate workflows on the fly
    - Events should be propagated saying for example 'I have completed this step'

#### Events in CICD Workstream to become SIG?
Let's continue the discussion on this idea brought up on last meeting.
- What about the relation to SIG Interoperability? To workstream Metadata? Others?
- Having a SIG means a bit more formality and also provides more visibility of the group.
- To Do: Level of effort and commitments for Working Group vs SIG. 
    - Having a SIG might attract more volunteers
- A charter would be needed for a SIG. We would benefit from creating a charter, given a clear scope and direction
    - We should work on the charter regardless of if we become a SIG or not
    - AP Andreas: Set up a Google docs where we could initiate the charter work
- There is a risk that this group could be slowed down due to the extra work needed
- What about the metadata workstream? Should it be part of this new SIG or SIG Interop?
- Sig Interop Charter: https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md#charter
- We should join the TOC in January to discuss this
    - Tracy will ask for us to get a point on the agenda for January 19th. No preparations needed from our end.
- Should SIG Interop be renamed to SIG events or should there be a separate SIG for it?
- Sig Repo: https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability

#### cdCon 2021
We should contribute to it
- cdCon will be in June
- CFP is not there yet
- 'Event driven CI/CD' could be a valid topic

#### Other conferences
- Online DevOps online summit, on Slack. Tracy has been asked to set up a CI/CD channel for it.
    - https://devopsonlinesummit.com/

#### Contribute to Metadata workstream
Metadata workstream is about to get started and we should provide any input we have that relates to metadata to it: [Standardized Metadata](https://hackmd.io/BYbkuR8uSlKt_w7Y4KE1OQ)
- We never discussed this agenda point at this meeting

#### Events Vocabulary
Let's progress the vocabulary discussions
- We never discussed this agenda point at this meeting

#### Next Meeting
Ok to meet December 21st, or should we postpone it till after xmas? What about Monday 4th of January in Epiphany week?
- Decided to meet December 21st
- 4th of January is skipped so first meeting after new year will be 18th of January

## Meeting November 23rd
Meeeting time in your timezone [here](https://time.is/1600_23_November_2020_in_UTC). You're welcome to join!

Participants:
* Ravi Lachhman, Harness
* Emil Bäckmark, Ericsson
* Mattias Linnér, Ericsson
* Cameron Motevasselani, Armory
* Andrea Frittoli, IBM
* Andreas Grimmer, Dynatrace
* Tracy Ragan, DeployHub

### Meeting Time
It was decided through a Slack discussion to move our meetings to 16.00 UTC starting from this meeting.

### Agenda

#### The life of this worksteam
- TR: Should this workstream be lifted to become it's own SIG? It would benefit the group and also CDF
- We should collect input from the SIG Interop about this idea on Thursday.
- The idea of lifting this to its own SIG should also be lifted to Dan Lorenc, to be discussed on the TOC level
- Suggested scope
    - What would an event driven CICD 'practice' look like?
    - Focusing on the event protocol or a higher level? Also including events infrastructure?
    - Focusing on a common events listener? Or instead of a provided events listener, it could be a layer on top of an existing cloudevents library meant to listen to and parse events in certain libraries
- We should get in people from Puppet as well, CircleCI, Argo, Codefresh, JFrog, Gitlab. And of course the existing: Harness, Keptn, Ortelius, Spinnaker, Weaveworks (for Flagger). And end-users like Ramin (eBay)
- Focus on tools for orchestration/workflows or also release/delivery/deployment tools?
- TR: Reasons for events in Ortelius
    - Regardless of platform used, the workflows should be able to state their progress and risk levels in a generic way. To enable 'smart CD pipelines'

#### Note:
- Member webinar around events next week (see CDF Calendar): 'CDF Ambassador Webinar: A Guide to Event-driven SRE-inspired DevOps', Wednesday December 2nd
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EZfvB2FFI837nMmArnyv-wizsIJvc-4_xdgfoUXF4o/edit?ts=5fb68361#heading=h.mspta0kuuv9j

#### Is the discussion frequency good as it is or should we increase it, through using the Slack channel or comments in the HackMD document?
- Discussion to be continued on this topic when/if the workstream is lifted to it's own SIG

#### Metadata group
- What about [the Standardized Metadata discussion](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/meetings.md#agenda-and-notes-1) that was brought up on last SIG meeting? How should it relate to our work in this workstream?
- If events in CICD will become a SIG then maybe the metadata group should be part of it 

### Community Specification
- [Community Specification](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0), would it be interesting for us to use?
    - It's about getting a head start in defining a new specification. Taking care of legal aspects etc.
    - It could be cloned or linked to from a new specification that we create for events
    - What about Cloudevents? Do they use this? Why? Why not?
    - It might already be covered within CDF, and therefore we might not need it. Should be asked to Tracy Miranda

* Eiffel Vocab (https://github.com/eiffel-community/eiffel/tree/master/eiffel-vocabulary)

#### What is working well in the Industry?
* Keptn is event driven.Follows Cloud Events spec. (https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md)

#### Existing event handling frameworks
What event frameworks do we know of?

##### Pure event consumers
* [Tekton Triggers](https://medium.com/@dlorenc/tekton-triggers-3aba132c6344)
* [Argo Events](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events)
* Various [Eiffel consumers](https://eiffel-community.github.io/)
* Others?

Timezone help: https://time.is/compare/1830_8_June_2020_in_CET/EST/PST

# Why we are here?
* Unique benefits of Event-driven CD pipelines
* Automation of CD processes

# Discussion
* Pipeline to Pipeline Communication 
* Context sent to decisions/Pipelines
* What is an event? - Cloud Events Project -> https://cloudevents.io/
* Message/Envelope: Long lived and routable. 
* Event: Immediate, consumable. An indication. 
* Structure of an Event (definition).
* Technology agnostic to what to be deploying to. 
* Harmonization of verbiage/vocabulary. -> https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/vocabulary.md
* When to Event? Trigger, Audit, Monitoring, Management
* Graphing of the entire process e.g through events. What truly occurs? 
* Metrics about Events; e.g how many people have subscribed? Alerting around Events. 

# Workstream name
We concluded to rename the workstream to 'events in CI/CD' to not narrow the scope of the work to just triggering or driving pipelines

# Next Steps
* Bi-Weekly Meetings at same time.
* Read up on the CDF SIG Interop vocabulary document - https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/vocabulary.md
* Read up on events proposal for Tekton - Ramin to provide link
* RA: Here's the link to Andrea Frittoli’s Actions and Notifications proposal:
