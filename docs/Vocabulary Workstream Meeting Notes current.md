## Meeting 25th January

Participants:

- Andrea Frittoli, IBM, UTC
- Mauricio Salatino, VMWare, UTC
- Erik Sternerson, doWhile
- Mattias Linnér, Ericsson
- Ishan Khare

Agenda:

- [CDEvents Marketing / PR Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1asktguMF_K4N5Vugn0EQ_dCyCgxZX69o2D02MRGzNjA/edit#)
- CDEvents Roadmap [PR](https://github.com/cdevents/spec/pull/9)
- Use Cases:
    - Proposed for PoC: https://hackmd.io/ZCS2KYKZTpKBqhU9PMuCew
    - Knative: https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-events/issues/107#issuecomment-1020995310 
    - (Andrea) KubeCon Talk submission focuses on the "Metrics" use case, so I would focus on building the spec around that area
        - Even if the talk is not accepted, it will make a good PoC - and there's probably a good overlap with the Knative use case too
    - Helping consuming services/tools understand what events to consume, actually consuming these events, and declaring what events it consumes, is something we should consider for the CDEvents project.
        - Related Interop PR https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/pull/81/files#
