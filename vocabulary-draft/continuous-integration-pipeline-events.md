# Continuous Integration Events

__Note:__ This is a work-in-progress draft version and is being worked on by members of the Events SIG. You are very welcome to join the work and the discussions!

These events are related to **Continuous Integration(CI)** activities. CI usually include activities such as building, testing, packaging and releasing software artifacts. 

The following events represent concrete Tasks that are associated with the execution of CI pipelines:

- **Build Queued**: a Build task has been queued, this build process usually is in charge of producing a binary from source code
- **Build Started**: a Build task has started 
- **Build Finished**: a Build task has finished, the event will contain the finished status, success, error or failure

The following Test events are defined in two separate categories **Test Case** and **Test Suite**. A **Test Case** is the smallest unit of testing that the user wants to track. A **Test Suite** is a collection of test case executions and/or other test suite executions. **Test Cases** executed, and Test Suites are for grouping purposes. For this reason, **Test Cases** can be queued. 

- **Test Case Queued**: a Test task has been queued, and it is waiting to be started
- **Test Case Started**: a Test task has started
- **Test Case Finished**: a Test task has finished, the event will contain the finished status, success, error or failure
- **Test Suite Started**: a Test task has started
- **Test Suite Finished**: a Test task has finished, the event will contain the finished status, success, error or failure

Finally, events needs to be generated for the output of the pipeline such as the artifacts that were packaged and released for others to use. 

- **Artifact Packaged**: an artifact has been packaged for distribution, this artifact is now versioned with a fixed version
- **Artifact Released**: an artifact has been released and it can be advertised for others to use

CI Events MUST include the following attributes:
 - **Event Type**: the type is restricted to include `CD.CI.**` prefix. For example `CD.CI.Build.Queued` or `CD.CI.Artifact.Packaged`
 - **Artifact Id**: the unique identifier of the artifact that the event is refering to.
