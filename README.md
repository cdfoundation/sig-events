## Group Charter

### Introduction

Today’s CI/CD systems do not talk to each other in a standardized way. This leads to problems related to interoperability, notification of failure issues, and poor automation.

This group is looking at how events can help to create CI/CD systems with a decoupled architecture that is easy to scale and makes it resilient to failures. Using events could also increase automation when connecting workflows from different systems to each other, and as a result empowering tracing/visualizing/auditing of the connected workflows through these events.

### Purpose

The group will focus on the use of events to provide interoperability through topics like:

- When are events suited? For triggers, audits, monitoring, management
  - Common guidelines for at-least-once, at-most-once, exactly once, ordering… When to apply what strategy?
- Best practices for event-driven CI/CD systems
- Events to be used by tools for orchestration/workflows
- Pipeline to pipeline communication via events
- Tracing/auditing/graphing/visualizing of the entire process, e.g., through events. What truly occurs?
- Metrics, e.g., how many versions have been deployed, how many PRs (Pull Requests) have been raised, how many events have been issued?
- How are events related and how are they ordered (links vs trace context)?

### Outcome

The group is working on a standardized event protocol that caters for technology agnostic machine-to-machine communication in CI/CD systems. This specification will be published, reviewed and agreed upon between relevant Linux Foundation projects/members.

The group aims to provide reference implementations such as event listeners and event senders on top of CloudEvents.

### History

This is group started as a work-stream within the CDF SIG Interoperability.
The forming of the workstream was suggested on a [SIG Interoperability meeting](https://github.com/cdfoundation/sig-interoperability/blob/master/docs/meetings_2020.md#May-28-2020) and its first meeting was held on June 8th 2020.
The SIG was formed in February 2021.

## What is an event?

We currently stick with the [definition used by CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#terminology):
An *event* is a data record expressing an *occurrence* and its context, where *occurrence* is the capture of a statement of fact during the operation of a software system.
